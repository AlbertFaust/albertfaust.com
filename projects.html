A linux script to detect the most dominant colours in a wallpaper and change the theme (terminal, vim etc.) colours to match the wallpaper. Written in C and ported to Java.

<h3>K-Means Clustering and Lloyd's Algorithm</h3>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-Means</a> is a cluster analysis technique for exploring a dataset. In <i>Wallpaper to Theme</i> the dataset is comprised of every pixel's RGB value. After the clusters have been formed, the center of the clusters will show the most dominant colours in the image.
<br>
<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<ul id="acc">
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Say we have a 100px*100px image. From this image we can get the RBG value of each pixel. This will give us 10,000 3 Dimensional points.</span></li>
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Now we choose our 3 initial cluster centroids. (For simplicity our initial points can be the RGB values for Red, Green and Blue)</span></li>
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Go through each pixel and assign it to it's nearest cluster centroid.</span></li>
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Now go through each cluster and recalculate it's new centroid based on the pixels assigned to it.</span></li>
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Keep reassigning the pixels and recalculating the centroids until the dominant colours have been found. </span></li>

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist">gravitational assist</a> simulator that simulates the motion of objects as they enter and exit gravitational fields. The program is written using C++ and OpenGL and uses 'real physics' applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion">Kepler's Laws</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation">Newtonian Gravitation</a> to simulate the gravitational slingshots.

<h3>Gravity Assist</h3>
A gravity assist is the act of getting close to a large gravitational body (like a planet) in order to speed up. In this process, the planet loses some of its orbital energy (conservation of energy) but the amount the planet loses is proportionately very small.
<h3>Development</h3>

This is a project that I plan on investing a lot of time in. I am very interested in Celestial Mechanics and want to work on a large Computer Graphics project. Some parts of the project I need to implement:

<ul id="acc">
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Fully working Solar System with textured planets and stars.</span></li>
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Ability to control camera and 'time'. 
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Accurate orbital physics using Kepler's Laws and Newtonian Gravitation.</span></li>
<li><span style=font-size:200%>Ability to generate 'planets' and see how a body reacts in the field.</span></li>
</ul>

<a href="https://github.com/AlbertFaust/game-of-life"><h7>Game of Life</h7></a>&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;<i>[C/JavaScript]</i><br>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Conway's Game of Life was the first program I ever wrote. It is a zero-player game, meaning that it evolves from the initial state without interference. The evolutions are determined by the following rules:
<ol>
    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.</li>
    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>
<a href="https://github.com/AlbertFaust/loop-web-scraper"><h7>Loop Web Scraper</h7></a>&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;<i>[Python]</i><br>
The online learning platform in DCU is called <a href="https://loop.dcu.ie/">Loop</a>. It is where all of the lecture notes are uploaded by lecturers and each year it is cleared and replaced with the notes for the current year. At the end of the year I wanted to download all of my notes. Performing this task by hand would take a long time and is very menial so I decided to write a scraper to do this for me. <br>
Unfortunately, the notes were removed before I finished writing the scraper so I have put the project on hold until closer to the end of the year.<br><br>
<a href="https://github.com/AlbertFaust/webdev"><h7>WebDev</h7></a>&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;<i>[HTML/Css/JavaScript]</i><br>
WebDev is a repository where I keep the websites I have created. (not including my personal <a href="http://www.albertfaust.com">albertfaust.com</a> site) At the moment the only site I have in the repo is the site I made during my internship for the <a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~pel/">Performance Engineering Laboratory.</a> The site still needs a few changes before it can be deployed but has been put on hold due to corrupted code.<br><br>

This is less of a project and more of a place where I can add additional scripts as I write them. It is made with the intention of being purely educational and is not designed for malicious use.<br>
